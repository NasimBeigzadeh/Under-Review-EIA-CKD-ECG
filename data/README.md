# Dataset

This directory contains documentation and instructions for obtaining and preparing the ECG datasets used in the experiments reported in the paper.

The proposed EIA-CKD framework was trained and evaluated using two publicly available benchmark datasets:

1. Chapman/Shaoxing 12-lead ECG Database
2. PTB-XL ECG Database

The original datasets are **not redistributed in this repository**. Users should obtain the datasets from their respective public sources and follow the preprocessing instructions provided in this repository.

## 1. Chapman/Shaoxing 12-lead ECG Database

The Chapman/Shaoxing dataset contains 12-lead ECG recordings sampled at 500 Hz with a duration of 10 seconds.

Four diagnostic classes were used in this study:

| Class | Description                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| SR    | Normal Sinus Rhythm                  |
| SB    | Sinus Bradycardia                    |
| GSVT  | General Supraventricular Tachycardia |
| AFIB  | Atrial Fibrillation                  |

### Dataset source

The dataset is publicly available through Kaggle:

## 2. PTB-XL ECG Dataset

PTB-XL is a large publicly available 12-lead ECG dataset containing clinical ECG recordings annotated by expert cardiologists.

In this study, the superdiagnostic classification scheme was adopted.

Five diagnostic classes were used:

| Class | Description            |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| NORM  | Normal ECG             |
| MI    | Myocardial Infarction  |
| STTC  | ST/T Change            |
| CD    | Conduction Disturbance |
| HYP   | Hypertrophy            |

### Dataset source

The PTB-XL dataset is publicly available through PhysioNet:

[PTB-XL — PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/)

Please refer to the official PhysioNet page for the dataset description, licensing, citation requirements, and access conditions.

## 3. Dataset Splits Used in This Study

The experiments reported in the paper used predefined training, validation, and test subsets.

### Chapman

| Class | Training | Validation | Test |
| ----- | -------: | ---------: | ---: |
| SR    |     1301 |        145 |  380 |
| SB    |     2821 |        308 |  760 |
| GSVT  |     1633 |        196 |  447 |
| AFIB  |     1599 |        169 |  457 |

### PTB-XL

| Class | Training | Validation | Test |
| ----- | -------: | ---------: | ---: |
| NORM  |     7243 |        914 |  912 |
| CD    |     1353 |        171 |  184 |
| HYP   |      415 |         64 |   56 |
| STTC  |     1903 |        255 |  242 |
| MI    |     2043 |        233 |  256 |

These distributions correspond to the experimental setup described in the manuscript.

## 5. Expected Directory Structure

After the preprocessing stage, the image data are expected to follow the directory structure required by `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`.

For Chapman:

```text
train/
├── AFIB/
├── GSVT/
├── SB/
└── SR/

valid/
├── AFIB/
├── GSVT/
├── SB/
└── SR/

test/
├── AFIB/
├── GSVT/
├── SB/
└── SR/
```

For PTB-XL:

```text
train/
├── CD/
├── HYP/
├── MI/
├── NORM/
└── STTC/

valid/
├── CD/
├── HYP/
├── MI/
├── NORM/
└── STTC/

test/
├── CD/
├── HYP/
├── MI/
├── NORM/
└── STTC/
```

Each class directory contains the ECG images generated during preprocessing.

---

## 6. Local Dataset Paths

The training code expects the processed datasets to be available locally.

The corresponding directories are:

```python
train_data_path = "/path/to/train"
valid_data_path = "/path/to/valid"
test_data_path = "/path/to/test"
```

The paths should be changed according to the location of the downloaded and processed datasets on the user's system.
